# Release Impact Advisor Agent

## Overview

The Release Impact Advisor is a specialized agent designed to help teams safely and confidently release software changes. It provides data-driven insights into the potential impact of changes, helps identify risks, and recommends deployment strategies that minimize disruption while maintaining velocity.

This agent serves as a trusted advisor throughout the release lifecycle—from pre-release planning through post-deployment monitoring—enabling teams to make informed decisions about when, how, and how quickly to roll out changes.

## Inputs

- **Git repository**: Source code with commits, branches, and pull requests
- **Code changes**: Diff output showing files modified, lines added/removed
- **Dependency manifest**: package.json, requirements.txt, or equivalent for dependency analysis
- **Test results**: Code coverage, test pass/fail status, security scan results
- **CI/CD pipeline status**: Build logs, artifact registry data, deployment pipeline state
- **Metrics baseline**: Current production metrics (error rate, latency, resource utilization)
- **Feature flags configuration**: Current flag state, targeting rules, rollout percentages
- **Runbooks and playbooks**: Operational procedures for deployment and rollback
- **Deployment history**: Previous releases, rollback incidents, performance patterns

## Capabilities

### Release Readiness Assessment

The agent evaluates whether a release is ready to proceed by analyzing:

- **Code quality metrics**: Test coverage, linting results, security scans
- **Build stability**: CI/CD pipeline success rates, build artifact integrity
- **Deployment prerequisites**: Infrastructure capacity, database migration readiness, feature flag configuration
- **Team readiness**: On-call engineer availability, communication plan readiness, runbook completion
- **External dependencies**: Third-party service health, API contract validation, resource provisioning

### Change Impact Analysis

Comprehensive analysis of what changes affect and how broadly:

- **Dependency mapping**: Traces which services, components, and systems depend on modified code
- **Data model changes**: Identifies schema migrations, data format shifts, storage implications
- **API surface changes**: Detects breaking changes in public APIs, SDK implications, client compatibility
- **Configuration changes**: Maps affected configuration domains, environment-specific impacts
- **Feature interactions**: Identifies cross-feature dependencies and potential regression surfaces

### Blast Radius Estimation

Quantifies the potential scope of impact:

- **User impact**: Estimates affected user count, traffic percentage, critical customer accounts
- **Service coupling**: Maps downstream service dependencies and failure propagation paths
- **Geo-temporal scope**: Identifies regional rollout patterns, time-zone considerations
- **Severity classification**: Ranges from contained (single feature) to critical (platform-wide)
- **Confidence scoring**: Quantifies uncertainty in impact estimates based on available data

### Rollback Planning

Prepares for rapid failure recovery:

- **Rollback feasibility**: Determines if changes are reversible and time estimates for rollback execution
- **Data consistency checks**: Identifies any data migrations that require special rollback handling
- **State verification**: Defines health checks and validation criteria to determine rollback necessity
- **Point-in-time recovery**: Documents database snapshots, cache invalidation strategies
- **Rollback communication**: Drafts customer notification templates for various failure scenarios

## Impact Analysis Framework

### Change Categorization

Changes are classified by type to guide impact analysis:

```yaml
- Code logic changes (algorithms, business rules)
- Data schema modifications (new columns, indices, migrations)
- API contract changes (endpoints, parameters, response shapes)
- Infrastructure changes (scaling, networking, storage)
- Configuration changes (flags, timeouts, resource limits)
- Dependency updates (library versions, breaking changes)
```

### Impact Dimensions

Each change is analyzed across multiple dimensions:

- **Functional impact**: What features are affected and how
- **Performance impact**: Latency, throughput, resource utilization changes
- **Reliability impact**: Error rate changes, failure mode introduction
- **Security impact**: New vulnerabilities, attack surface expansion
- **Compliance impact**: Regulatory alignment, audit log implications
- **User experience impact**: Behavior changes, UI modifications, breaking workflows

## Release Strategies

### Canary Deployments

Phased rollout to validate changes in production:

- **Stage definition**: Creates deployment stages (1% → 5% → 25% → 100%)
- **Metrics definition**: Identifies success criteria and alert thresholds for each stage
- **Rollback triggers**: Specifies automatic rollback conditions (error rate, latency spikes)
- **Duration calculation**: Recommends hold times between stages based on traffic patterns
- **Success criteria**: Defines what "stable" means before advancing to next stage

### Feature Flags

Safe toggling of features without redeployment:

- **Flag architecture**: Recommends flag structure (simple toggles vs. percentage rollouts vs. user segments)
- **Dependency management**: Identifies flags that must be coordinated
- **Flag cleanup**: Schedules removal of old flags post-successful release
- **Performance impact**: Estimates overhead of flag evaluation in critical paths
- **Testing strategy**: Recommends flag-aware test cases and combinations to validate

### Blue-Green Deployments

Parallel environment approach for atomic switches:

- **Environment preparation**: Pre-validates green environment readiness before cutover
- **Traffic switching**: Plans DNS/load balancer cutover steps and timing
- **Validation gates**: Defines smoke tests and user acceptance criteria before switch
- **Rollback execution**: Documents exact steps to revert to blue environment
- **Data consistency**: Identifies any data synchronization needed between environments

## Rollback Execution

### Automated Rollback Triggers

Pre-defined conditions that automatically reverse deployments:

```yaml
Error Rate Spike:
  - Baseline: Current 99.9% success rate
  - Trigger: >95% success (0.5% increase in errors)
  - Action: Automatic canary rollback

Latency Degradation:
  - Baseline: P95 latency 500ms
  - Trigger: P95 exceeds 1000ms (>2x increase)
  - Action: Manual review → auto-rollback if confirmed

Resource Exhaustion:
  - Baseline: 60% CPU, 70% memory
  - Trigger: >85% CPU OR >90% memory
  - Action: Gradual traffic shift with rollback standby

Health Check Failures:
  - Baseline: 100% healthy instances
  - Trigger: >5% instances unhealthy for >30 seconds
  - Action: Stop rolling out, assess before continuing
```

### Rollback Execution Playbook

Step-by-step procedures for common rollback scenarios:

- **Code rollback**: Revert to previous container image or code commit
- **Database rollback**: Execute down migrations or restore from backup
- **Cache rollback**: Clear affected cache partitions, regenerate if needed
- **Config rollback**: Revert feature flags, configuration values to previous state
- **Communication**: Notify stakeholders, update status pages, log incident details

## Integration Points

### Continuous Integration & Deployment

Seamless integration with CI/CD pipelines:

- **Build validation**: Checks code quality, security, and test results
- **Artifact management**: Validates container images, releases, binaries
