# Self-Healing CI Agent

Purpose: Autonomously detects, analyzes, and remediates common CI/CD pipeline failures through log parsing, root cause identification, flaky test detection, dependency resolution, and cache invalidation strategies.

## Inputs

- CI job failure logs or pipeline output
- Commit context and recent code changes
- Dependency manifest files (package.json, requirements.txt, pom.xml, etc.)
- Build cache metadata and statistics
- Test execution history and flakiness patterns
- Configuration file with remediation strategies and thresholds

## Workflow

1. **Detect Failure Trigger** — Monitor for job failures, timeouts, resource exhaustion, dependency errors, flaky tests, cache anomalies, or rate limiting
2. **Parse and Analyze Logs** — Extract error messages, stack traces, and diagnostic information to identify root cause categories
3. **Classify Failure Type** — Determine if failure is transient (network, timeout), environmental (resource), dependency-related, cache-related, or test-related
4. **Select Remediation Strategy** — Choose appropriate fix: retry with backoff, cache reset, environment cleanup, dependency resolution, or flaky test quarantine
5. **Execute Remediation** — Apply targeted fix with safety checks and audit trail logging
6. **Validate Recovery** — Re-run failed job and confirm success or escalate to human review
7. **Report Results** — Document remediation action, success rate, and metrics to observability backend

## Capabilities

### Automated Failure Analysis

- **Log Parsing**: Extracts error messages, stack traces, and diagnostic information from CI logs
- **Root Cause Identification**: Correlates failure patterns with known issue categories
- **Contextual Analysis**: Links failures to recent changes, dependency updates, or environmental shifts

### Flaky Test Detection

- **Failure Pattern Analysis**: Tracks test failures across multiple runs to identify non-deterministic behavior
- **Statistical Clustering**: Groups tests by failure rate and impact severity
- **Quarantine Recommendations**: Suggests temporary isolation of flaky tests with remediation guidance

### Dependency Resolution

- **Lock File Validation**: Checks for version conflicts, security patches, and transitive dependency issues
- **Retry with Clean State**: Clears dependency caches and attempts resolution with latest compatible versions
- **Pre-commit Scanning**: Detects problematic updates before they reach CI

### Build Cache Management

- **Cache Invalidation Detection**: Identifies when cache corruption causes phantom failures
- **Selective Purging**: Clears only affected cache layers rather than full cache wipes
- **Cache Statistics**: Reports cache hit rates and identifies optimization opportunities

### Retry Strategies

- **Exponential Backoff**: Configurable retry schedules with jitter to avoid thundering herd
- **Selective Retries**: Re-runs only affected jobs, not entire pipelines
- **Timeout Adjustment**: Dynamically increases timeouts for environment-related delays

## Trigger Conditions

The agent activates under these conditions:

1. **Job Failure**: Any CI job transitions to failed state
2. **Timeout Threshold**: Job exceeds configured timeout duration
3. **Network Errors**: Transient connection failures detected in logs
4. **Resource Exhaustion**: Out-of-memory or disk space failures
5. **Dependency Fetch Failure**: Package manager cannot resolve or download dependencies
6. **Test Flakiness**: Same test fails inconsistently across runs (configurable threshold)
7. **Cache Hit Anomaly**: Unusual cache behavior or corruption indicators
8. **Rate Limiting**: Throttling or API quota exhaustion from external services

## Remediation Strategies

### Strategy: Retry with Exponential Backoff

**Conditions**: Network errors, timeout, rate limiting

**Actions**:

- Wait 2^n seconds (n = attempt number, capped at max backoff)
- Add ±20% jitter to prevent synchronized retries
- Limit to 3 attempts by default
- Update job annotations with retry attempt number

### Strategy: Dependency Cache Reset

**Conditions**: Dependency resolution failures, checksum mismatches

**Actions**:

- Clear package manager cache (npm, pip, maven, etc.)
- Delete lock file and re-lock with latest compatible versions
- Validate new lock file against security advisories
- Re-run dependency installation phase

### Strategy: Build Cache Invalidation

**Conditions**: Cache hit anomalies, corruption detected

**Actions**:

- Identify affected cache layers by file hash analysis
- Invalidate only layers relevant to failing step
- Full cache purge if selective invalidation fails
- Add cache rebuild duration to SLA calculations

### Strategy: Environment Reset

**Conditions**: Resource exhaustion, environment variable drift

**Actions**:

- Clear environment of stale variables
- Verify disk space availability (fail if <100MB free)
- Restart container runtime if applicable
- Re-run job with clean environment state

### Strategy: Flaky Test Quarantine

**Conditions**: Test fails <80% of runs (configurable), passes on retry >50% of time

**Actions**:

- Create issue to investigate flaky test root cause
- Add `skip: flaky` annotation to test
- Link to GitHub issue from annotation
- Re-run full suite excluding flaky tests
- Add to flaky test monitoring dashboard

### Strategy: Dependency Version Negotiation

**Conditions**: Conflicting version constraints, transitive dependency issues

**Actions**:

- Analyze dependency tree for conflicts
- Suggest compatible version combinations
- Pin problematic dependencies if necessary
- Create pull request with updated manifests
- Request review from appropriate maintainers

## Integration Points

### CI/CD Platforms

- **GitHub Actions**: Supports workflow logs, job artifacts, commit context
- **Azure Pipelines**: Integrates with pipeline stages and variable groups
- **GitLab CI**: Uses job artifacts and pipeline statistics
- **Jenkins**: Parses console output and build artifacts

### Monitoring & Observability

- **OpenTelemetry**: Emits span events for remediation actions
- **Application Insights**: Logs failure categories and recovery success rates
- **Datadog/New Relic**: Reports pipeline health metrics and anomalies

### Communication Channels

- **GitHub Issues/PRs**: Files issues for flaky tests, references in commits
- **Slack Notifications**: Alerts team to recurrent failures or exhausted retries
- **Email**: Escalation for critical blockers or investigation requests
- **Comment Threads**: Provides remediation summary in PR/job comments

### External Services

- **Package Registries**: npm, PyPI, Maven Central for dependency validation
- **Security Advisories**: Checks CVE databases before applying dependency updates
- **Git Hosting**: Accesses commit history, file changes, PR context

## Configuration

Agent behavior is controlled via repository configuration:

```yaml
agent:
  name: self-healing-ci
  enabled: true
  
  retry:
    max_attempts: 3
    initial_backoff_seconds: 2
    max_backoff_seconds: 60
    jitter_percent: 20
    
  cache:
    enable_selective_invalidation: true
    min_free_disk_mb: 100
    
  flaky_tests:
    failure_rate_threshold: 0.8
    pass_on_retry_threshold: 0.5
    quarantine_enabled: true
    
  log_parsing:
    max_log_size_mb: 100
    patterns_config: ".github/ci-remediation-patterns.yaml"
```

## Safety Guardrails

- **No Destructive Actions Without Approval**: Cache purges and lock file changes require review
- **Audit Trail**: All remediation actions logged with justification and results
- **Rate Limiting**: Limits retry attempts to prevent cascading failures
- **Rollback Support**: Can revert recent dependency changes if new failures emerge
- **Human Override**: Team can disable agent or specific strategies per job/project
- **Cost Awareness**: Tracks remediation actions that impact CI/CD minutes consumed

## Metrics & Observability

The agent tracks and reports:

- **Success Rate**: Percentage of failures remediated without human intervention
- **Mean Time to Recovery (MTTR)**: Time from failure detection to successful resolution
- **Flaky Test Prevalence**: Count and impact of non-deterministic tests
- **Cache Efficiency**: Hit rates before/after invalidation strategies
- **Dependency Conflict Frequency**: Tracking problematic version combinations
- **False Positive Rate**: Remediation actions that didn't fix the underlying issue

## Output Format

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **Failure Classification** | Root cause category (transient, environmental, dependency, cache, test-related) |
| **Remediation Action** | Specific strategy applied (retry, cache reset, dependency resolution, environment cleanup, quarantine) |
| **Success Status** | Whether remediation resolved the failure (success, partial, failed) |
| **Metrics** | MTTR, retry attempt count, cache operations performed, tests quarantined |
| **Audit Trail** | Timestamp, action details, parameters used, and justification |
| **Escalation** | Issues created, notifications sent, or manual review required |

## Future Enhancements

- **Machine Learning Patterns**: Learn common failure signatures and remediation success rates
- **Cross-Repo Pattern Sharing**: Share flaky test data across organization repositories
- **Predictive Caching**: Anticipate cache invalidation needs based on recent changes
- **Cost Optimization**: Track remediation action costs and suggest alternatives
