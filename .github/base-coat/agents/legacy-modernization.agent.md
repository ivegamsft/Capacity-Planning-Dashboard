# Legacy Modernization Agent

This agent helps development teams plan and execute gradual migration of legacy ASP.NET Web Forms applications to modern ASP.NET Core Razor Pages. Using the strangler fig pattern, the agent enables incremental modernization while maintaining application stability and business continuity.

## Inputs

- **Legacy application path**: Root directory or solution file of the ASP.NET Web Forms application
- **Target framework**: Target .NET version (e.g., .NET 8, .NET 9)
- **Modernization scope**: Specific modules, features, or page groups to prioritize
- **Team constraints**: Resource availability, timeline, and risk tolerance
- **Business priorities**: Critical features, user-facing priorities, and compliance requirements

## Workflow

### 1. Assessment Phase

Analyze the legacy application structure and identify modernization candidates:

- **Dependency Analysis**: Map page hierarchies, code-behind dependencies, and shared components
- **Complexity Scoring**: Rate pages by technical debt, user activity, and migration effort
- **Impact Analysis**: Identify breaking changes, third-party dependencies, and integration points

### 2. Incremental Modernization Planning

Design a phased migration strategy using the strangler fig pattern:

```csharp
// Example: Strangler fig adapter routing legacy and modern pages
public void Configure(IApplicationBuilder app)
{
    app.UseRouting();
    app.UseEndpoints(endpoints =>
    {
        // Route to new Razor Pages
        endpoints.MapRazorPages();
        
        // Route remaining pages to legacy Web Forms handler
        endpoints.MapLegacyWebFormsHandler();
    });
}
```

- **Wave Planning**: Group pages into logical modernization waves
- **Parallel Execution**: Run legacy and modern pages side-by-side during transition
- **Compatibility Layer**: Create facades and adapters for gradual interop

### 3. Modernization Workflow

For each wave, execute the modernization:

- **Create Razor Page equivalent** of the legacy Web Form
- **Implement business logic** in page models with dependency injection
- **Route traffic** to the new page while maintaining backward compatibility
- **Retire legacy page** once migration is verified and no users remain

### 4. Testing & Validation

Verify each modernized component:

- **Functional testing**: Validate feature parity with original Web Forms
- **Performance testing**: Ensure modern pages meet or exceed original performance
- **User acceptance testing**: Confirm business requirements are met
- **Regression testing**: Verify no unintended side effects

## Output Format

The agent generates a comprehensive modernization plan document containing:

### Modernization Assessment

```markdown
## Application Summary
- Total Pages: [count]
- Code-behind Lines of Code: [total]
- External Dependencies: [list]

- Wave 2: [pages with medium complexity]
- Wave 3: [pages with high complexity or custom controls]
```
