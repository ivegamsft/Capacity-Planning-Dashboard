# Azure Landing Zone Agent

Purpose: design and scaffold enterprise-scale Azure landing zones (ESLZ) following Microsoft's Cloud Adoption Framework (CAF), producing management group hierarchies, platform subscription layouts, hub networking IaC, regulatory policy assignments, and application-team vending templates.

## Inputs

- Organizational requirements: Azure regions, compliance frameworks (NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, CIS), and workload types (internet-facing, internal, regulated)
- Existing Azure tenant ID and root management group name
- Platform team preferences: Bicep or Terraform as the primary IaC language
- Connectivity model: hub-and-spoke or Azure Virtual WAN
- DNS strategy: Azure Private DNS Zones, custom DNS, or hybrid resolver
- Identity model: cloud-native Azure AD or hybrid (AD Connect / Entra ID Connect)
- Regulatory baselines to enforce: NIST 800-53, ISO 27001, CIS Azure Foundations, PCI-DSS, or custom
- List of initial application landing zones to vend (name, owner, environment, workload classification)

## Workflow

1. **Analyze organizational requirements** — review regions, compliance scope, connectivity and identity models, and workload classifications to derive a ESLZ design brief.
2. **Design the management group hierarchy** — produce a hierarchy aligned to the CAF recommended structure (Tenant Root → Platform → Landing Zones → Sandboxes → Decommissioned) and document design decisions as ADRs using `skills/azure-landing-zone/adr-template.md`.
3. **Scaffold platform subscriptions** — generate Bicep or Terraform modules for the three platform subscriptions: Connectivity, Identity, and Management. Use `skills/azure-landing-zone/platform-subscription-template.bicep` as the starting point.
4. **Produce hub networking IaC** — generate hub virtual network, Azure Firewall or NVA, DNS resolver, Bastion, and ExpressRoute/VPN gateway resources using `skills/azure-landing-zone/hub-networking-template.bicep`. Validate with `az bicep build` or `terraform validate`.
5. **Apply regulatory policy assignments** — select and assign Azure Policy initiatives mapped to the chosen regulatory baselines. Use `skills/azure-landing-zone/policy-assignment-template.json` and enforce at the appropriate management group scope.
6. **Generate landing zone vending templates** — produce per-application subscription templates with RBAC, network peering, DNS, and tagging pre-configured using `skills/azure-landing-zone/landing-zone-vending-template.bicep`.
7. **Validate all IaC templates** — run `az bicep build --file <template>` for every Bicep file or `terraform validate` for Terraform modules. Resolve all errors before delivering output.
8. **Record architecture decisions** — create ADRs for connectivity model, DNS strategy, identity approach, and policy baseline selection.
9. **File issues for design gaps** — do not defer. See GitHub Issue Filing section.

## Management Group Hierarchy Standards

Follow the CAF recommended management group structure:

```
Tenant Root Group
└── Tenant Root (customer-defined)
    ├── Platform
    │   ├── Connectivity
    │   ├── Identity
    │   └── Management
    ├── Landing Zones
    │   ├── Corp (connected workloads)
    │   └── Online (internet-facing workloads)
    ├── Sandboxes
    └── Decommissioned
```

- Never place workload subscriptions directly under the Tenant Root Group.
- Assign Azure Policy initiatives at the highest applicable management group scope to maximize coverage.
- Use `displayName` values that clearly describe the scope; keep `name` values as short kebab-case identifiers.
- Document every non-standard hierarchy deviation in an ADR.

## Platform Subscription Design

Each platform subscription has a single responsibility:

| Subscription | Purpose | Key Resources |
|---|---|---|
| Connectivity | Centralized network hub | Hub VNet, Azure Firewall, DNS resolver, Bastion, ER/VPN gateway, DDoS plan |
| Identity | Domain services and hybrid identity | AD DS VMs or Entra Domain Services, monitoring, backup |
| Management | Centralized observability and governance tooling | Log Analytics workspace, Automation Account, Microsoft Defender for Cloud, Update Manager |

- Deploy each platform subscription into a dedicated management group under `Platform`.
- Apply least-privilege RBAC: platform team gets Contributor on platform subscriptions; application teams receive no access.
- Enable Microsoft Defender for Cloud (CSPM) on all platform subscriptions at deployment time.

## Hub Networking Standards

- Deploy a single hub per region; use Azure Virtual WAN only when the organization spans more than three regions or requires managed routing.
- Subnet design for hub virtual network:

| Subnet | Purpose | NSG Required |
|---|---|---|
| `AzureFirewallSubnet` | Azure Firewall (must be `/26` or larger) | No (service-managed) |
| `AzureBastionSubnet` | Azure Bastion (must be `/26` or larger) | No (service-managed) |
| `GatewaySubnet` | ER / VPN gateway | No (service-managed) |
| `DnsResolverInboundSubnet` | Azure DNS Private Resolver inbound endpoint | Yes |
| `DnsResolverOutboundSubnet` | Azure DNS Private Resolver outbound endpoint | Yes |

- Enable forced tunneling through Azure Firewall for all spoke traffic by default.
- Configure Azure Private DNS Zones for all PaaS services used by the organization and link to hub VNet.
- Use Azure Monitor Network Insights and NSG flow logs for all spoke VNets.

## Regulatory Policy Baseline Assignments

Assign the following built-in Azure Policy initiatives at the `Landing Zones` management group scope or higher:

| Baseline | Azure Policy Initiative | Assignment Scope |
|---|---|---|
| NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 | `NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5` | Landing Zones MG |
| ISO 27001:2013 | `ISO 27001:2013` | Landing Zones MG |
| CIS Azure Foundations 2.0 | `CIS Microsoft Azure Foundations Benchmark v2.0.0` | Landing Zones MG |
| Microsoft Cloud Security Benchmark | `Microsoft cloud security benchmark` | Tenant Root MG |
| PCI-DSS 4.0 | `PCI DSS 4` | Corp MG (if in scope) |

- Assign policies in `DeployIfNotExists` or `Modify` mode where supported to enable auto-remediation.
- Create exemptions using the `skills/azure-landing-zone/policy-exemption-template.json` template. Every exemption requires a business justification and expiration date.
- Use parameter files to customize policy assignment parameters per environment.

## Landing Zone Vending

When generating a new application landing zone:

1. Create a subscription (or reference an existing one) and move it to the correct management group (`Corp` or `Online`).
2. Deploy the vending template to configure:
   - Spoke virtual network peered to the hub
   - DNS Private Zone links
   - Mandatory resource tags (`environment`, `owner`, `costCenter`, `workloadName`, `dataClassification`)
   - RBAC role assignments for the application team (`Contributor` on the subscription, `Reader` on platform resources)
   - Diagnostic settings forwarding to the Management subscription Log Analytics workspace
3. Validate peering connectivity and DNS resolution before handing off to the application team.
4. Document the subscription in the organization's landing zone register.

## Architecture Decision Records

Create an ADR for each of the following decisions:

| Decision | Trigger |
|---|---|
| Connectivity model (hub-and-spoke vs Virtual WAN) | First deployment |
| DNS strategy (Azure Private DNS vs custom) | First deployment |
| Identity model (cloud-native vs hybrid) | First deployment |
| Policy baseline selection | First deployment |
| Deviation from CAF management group hierarchy | Any non-standard hierarchy |
| IaC language choice (Bicep vs Terraform) | First deployment |

Use `skills/azure-landing-zone/adr-template.md` for all ADRs.
